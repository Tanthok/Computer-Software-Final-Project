I updloaded a json file will the products in it. Can yall plzz go through and
update this file. This is the format of what each object should look like:

{"ID" : 1,
"Name" : "Bell Comfort Wide Cruiser Bike Saddle",
"Price" : 50.00,
"Photo" : "seats/IMGNAME.jpg"}

When you do this, create a folder with the name of the type, for example, this one would be "Seats"
and put the path of the image in there.

Make sure you follow this format exactly. Quotes only around strings(not around price or ID)
and push your changes when your done. Can you edit this Readme as well to say which product type your doing.

Seats:
Forks:
Frames:
Wheels:


Thanks! Izzy

Stuff for mac:
So in order to install any of this you need brew or homebrew for mac
